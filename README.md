# Cardboard Boxes

Cardboard Boxes is a mod that adds an early game alternative to shulker boxes! Because convenience shouldn't be exclusively for the rich!

You can craft a cardboard box quite early with the following recipe:

You can even dye your box after you've made it!

(featuring Spob the Spider, he's not included in the mod)

Of course, there are a few key differences between the cardboard box and the shulker box. The most noticable being that cardboard boxes only hold 9 stacks of items rather than 27. However, cardboard boxes do not need space above them to be opened. Cardboard boxes will also break instanly with your fists.

Hopefully you have something more valuable to store than raw cod, happy boxing!
